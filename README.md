# Radish Common Tools

This repository provides a common set of libraries and tools that I use in all my Unity projects.

At this stage documentation is very poor. Use at your own risk (or annoy me for help).

```
git submodule add https://github.com/Valax321/RadishTools.git com.radish.common-tools
```
