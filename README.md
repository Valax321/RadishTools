# Radish Common Tools

This repository provides a common set of libraries and tools that I use in all my Unity projects.

At this stage documentation is very poor. Use at your own risk (or annoy me for help).

Assemblies:
- Common: Standalone tools and utility methods available at runtime.
- CommonEditor: Standalone tools and utility methods available in the editor.
